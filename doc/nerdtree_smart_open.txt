*nerdtree_smart_open.txt*     Nerdtree plugin for opening files/directories using third party applications.


USAGE                                   *nerdtree-smart-open*

Use default open mappings ('o' or '<CR>') to open files under the cursor
inside of the NERDTree window.  The effect will be only in the case that
the file extension will match with on of the extensions, specified in
g:nerdtree_smart_open_extensions.

Alternatively you can use <C-o> to open a file/directory ignoring both
default and custom extensions.
